# CRONOPETE

A backup utility for Linux.

Cronopete is a backup utility for Linux, modeled after Apple's Time Machine. It aims to simplify the creation of periodic backups.

By default, cronopete does a backup each hour, adding to the new backup only the files that have changed since the last one. This allows to return to a previous backup in an specific instant of time.

It is important to have a generous external disk for backups. It is strongly recommended to use a disk of, at least, twice the size of the data to store. SSD disks aren't recommended, because their speed gain is unnecessary for a backup, and are much more expensive than a mechanical disk. An external, USB3, mechanical disk with plenty of free space is an excellent choice for storing your backups.

## INTERNALS

Internally, Cronopete relies on RSync to do the backups. It also uses hard links to store the files that haven't changed from the last backup. This allows to have the full file tree without wasting disk space. Also, to avoid using too much CPU time and ensure that Cronopete doesn't interfere with the day-to-day work, the priority of the RSync process is set to the lowest possible.

To ensure that backups are always complete and atomic, it first does a copy in a temporary folder with an easy-to-detect name. If the backup fails or is stopped (like when the user shuts down the computer), it can be detected and deleted the next time. After a successful backup, a *sync* command is executed to ensure that the whole data has been stored physically in the hard disk. Only then the folder is renamed to its final name, and another *sync* command is executed.

To simplify specification of custom backup exclusions, if there is a file `.cronopete_exclude_from` in root of the folder you are backing up, it will be added as an `--exclude-from` option to the `rsync` command.

## BUILDING CRONOPETE

To build Cronopete, you need to install CMake or Meson/Ninja, Vala-0.30 or later, and Gtk 3.10 or later.

For CMake building, type

    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

and for Meson/Ninja, type

    mkdir MESON
    cd MESON
    meson
    ninja
    sudo ninja install

This will compile Cronopete and install it systemwide.

There are several dependencies for building it. For Debian/Ubuntu, you can check the file **debian/control**, and install all the packages specified in the lines *Depends* and *Build-Depends*. For Redhat/Fedora, check **rpmbuild/SPECS/cronopete.spec** and install the packages specified in the lines with *Requires* and *BuildRequires*. For Arch Linus, check **pkgbuild** and the packages in *depends* and *makedepends*.

## DBUS INTERFACE

Cronopete offers a DBus interface to allow a remote control. It is at the session bus, at the address **com.rastersoft.cronopete**. The object **com/rastersoft/cronopete** offers the **com.rastersoft.cronopete** interface, which has the follow methods:

* DoPing(Int32) -> Int32 : receives a 32bit integer and returns that integer plus 1. Useful for tests.
* DoBackup() : starts a backup now
* StopBakup() : ends the current backup
* ShowPreferences() : shows the preferences window
* RestoreFiles() : shows the restore interface
* RestoreFilesFromFolder(string folder) : shows the restore interface, setting it to show the specified folder. The folder can be passed as an URI (file:///...). This is useful for integration with file managers.
* UnmountBackupDisk() : tries to unmount the backup disk. If it is not possible (because it is not mounted, or there is a backup in progress) it will return an error
* SetStatus(boolean) : enables or disables the backup process
